            \textit{Satellite-based CDN }\ref{pub:starcdn}
            \begin{highlights}
                \item Proposed StarCDN, a novel LEO satellite-based CDN architecture that achieves low latency and high bandwidth usage via consistent hashing and orbit-aware relayed fetch.
                \item Achieved 15\% hit rate improvement against baseline LRU design.
                \item Independently developed an open-source CDN synthetic trace generator, in collaboration with Akamai, for geographically diverse traffic with theoretically proven cache- and object-level properties.
                \item Trace generator achieved $<$2\% error in caching characteristics.

                \item Identified discrepancies in 37\% of cloud storage APIs and dissected the root causes and manifestations into 8 findings.
                \item Contributed to a testing proxy middleware that automatically detects discrepancies between cloud and emulator APIs, which carries out CI workflows with high fidelity while minimizing costs.
